== Annual ==
Annual is a program to remind you for annual events like birthdays, holidays, etc.
It consists of a GUI-application providing the possibility to create, edit and query a database 
and of a console application for displaying events without graphical dependencies.
Additionally, the project provides a script which can import various file formats

== Installation ==
Starting the first time will show you a wizard which can create a new database file for your annual dates to remind. 
Just specify a filename for your database by clicking "New database".

== Populating data ==
Finally, the program will show you a list and an edit tab. 
First write all your data in the edit tab. 
The last line is always empty, e.g. putting data in this line creates a new entry. 
The list tab will be magically populated with the data entered in the edit tab. 
You can control your input data by reviewing the results shown in the list tab which displays all dates.

== Usage ==
By invoking `annual.exe -q`, the program will only spawn a window, if there is anything to remind 
(e.g. you can specify in the option 'warning days' in the configuration the dayspan in which a date is considered as 'remindable').
Putting a link to "annual.exe -q" in your autorun folder should finish the setup. 

== Without X ==
You can also run the application in console mode by parameter "-l".
Console mode only displays events (e.g. you have no editor).
This mode is useful if you want to be reminded when opening a terminal.
A possible scenario is to put the output in /etc/motd by cron. Just add to your crontab
@daily annual -l > /etc/motd
